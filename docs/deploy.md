# Kipple: backups, recovery and phase 2 deploy

For the owner to merge into the local `deploy-local/RUNBOOK.md` (that file is gitignored, so this one
travels with the repo). Commands run from Host-B as `ssh host-a '...'`, in the compose project
`host-a` at `/home/user/stack`. Never a bare `docker compose up` or `down`: always name `kipple`.

The container is distroless: no shell, no `ls`, no `rm`. The binary is the entrypoint, so a
subcommand is `docker exec kipple /kipple <command>` on the running container, or
`docker compose run --rm -T --no-deps kipple <command>` on a stopped service (it starts a throwaway
container on the same volume, publishes no port and ignores the restart policy).

## Where things live

Everything is on the `kipple_data` volume (`host-a_kipple_data`), mounted at `/data`.

| Path in the container | What | Kept |
|---|---|---|
| `/data/kipple.db` (+ `-wal`, `-shm`) | The database. Never copy it while the server runs | live |
| `/data/kipple.lock` | Held by `serve` (an OS lock: it vanishes with the process, no stale lock) | live |
| `/data/backup/kipple-snapshot.db` | Nightly snapshot at 04:10 (`tz` setting), consistent, safe to copy | 1 |
| `/data/backup/pre-migration-<from>-<to>-<ns>.db` | Written before a schema migration | newest 3 |
| `/data/backup/pre-restore-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>/` | The database that `kipple restore` replaced | newest 3 |
| `/data/backup/export/` | Temporary files of an export in progress. Emptied at startup | transient |

These are all on the same disk as the database. They protect against a bad migration or a bad
restore, not against losing Host-A. An off-box copy is the export (below) or a `docker cp` of the
nightly snapshot.

To look inside the volume (there is no shell in the Kipple image):

    ssh host-a 'docker run --rm -v host-a_kipple_data:/data:ro alpine ls -la /data /data/backup'

## Export a backup (the button)

Settings, Export backup. The app calls `POST /api/backup`, which answers at once when the build is quick and otherwise with `202 {job_id}`; the app then polls `GET /api/backup/jobs/<id>` until it is `ready` (the build carries on if the browser tab closes or Cloudflare cuts the request at about 100 s; a big database can take minutes). It shows the `warning` text and the size,
then starts the download of `GET /api/backup/<token>`, which saves as
`kipple-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.zip`. Save it off Host-A, for example on Host-B in
`<backup-dir>\kipple\`.

- The zip holds `kipple.db` (a consistent snapshot), `feeds.opml` (imports into any reader),
  `settings.json` (readable copy), `manifest.json` (versions, counts, SHA-256 of every file) and
  `RESTORE.txt`. It is roughly a third of the database size.
- **The file is sensitive.** It contains the web and Reader API password hashes, the account secret
  that signs Reader tokens and image links, hashed session ids, and any feed logins (HTTP Basic
  `user:password`, stored in plain text). Keep it private.
- The link is single use and expires after 5 minutes. If the transfer breaks, export again.
- "Busy" (409): the nightly snapshot or another export is running. Retry in a few seconds.
  "Not enough free disk space" (507): the volume needs about 2.2 times the database size free.
- Exports never block feed fetching: the snapshot only holds a read view.

The database only grows so much: an export is refused above 4 GiB. Past that, use the nightly
snapshot with `docker cp`:

    ssh host-a 'docker cp kipple:/data/backup/kipple-snapshot.db /tmp/k.db' && scp host-a:/tmp/k.db '<backup-dir>\kipple\' && ssh host-a 'rm /tmp/k.db'

That copies the snapshot only, never the live database or WAL.

## Reset the web password

Works while the server runs. At a terminal, without echo, asked twice:

    ssh -t host-a 'docker exec -it kipple /kipple password'

From a script or a pipe (one line on standard input; mind shell history and the process list):

    printf '%s\n' "$NEW" | ssh host-a 'docker exec -i kipple /kipple password --stdin'

Rules: 5 to 256 characters. It signs out every web session **and revokes every Reader API token**
(it rotates the account secret), so afterwards: sign in again in the browser, and re-enter the
Reader API password in Reeder and NetNewsWire (that password itself is unchanged; if you have lost
it too, `docker exec kipple /kipple api-password` sets a new one). The failed-login lockout is in
memory: it clears when its 15-minute window ends or on a restart. If `KIPPLE_PASSWORD` is still in
`/home/user/stack/.env`, remove it: it is read only when the account is first created.

## Restore a backup

`kipple restore` replaces the database with a backup zip (or a bare `.db` such as a snapshot). It
refuses while the server runs (the lock), verifies checksums and integrity, refuses a database
from a newer Kipple than this binary, keeps the current database under
`/data/backup/pre-restore-<timestamp>/`, and signs every web session out. Without `--yes` it only
verifies and reports.

Runbook, with the backup on Host-B (it is piped in; the container user cannot read `/import`):

    # 1. Stop the server (named service only).
    ssh host-a 'cd /home/user/stack && docker compose stop kipple'

    # 2. Verify without changing anything. Read the counts and the date it prints.
    ssh host-a 'cd /home/user/stack && docker compose run --rm -T --no-deps kipple restore -' < kipple-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.zip

    # 3. Restore for real.
    ssh host-a 'cd /home/user/stack && docker compose run --rm -T --no-deps kipple restore - --yes' < kipple-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.zip

    # 4. Start it and check the feed count and last fetch on /_status.
    ssh host-a 'cd /home/user/stack && docker compose up -d kipple && docker logs --tail 20 kipple'

An older schema is migrated on that start, after the usual `pre-migration-*` snapshot. Then sign in
again. A restore never touches a backup `.zip`.

**Undo a restore.** Stop `kipple`, then restore the previous database from the volume (list it with
the `alpine ls` command above):

    ssh host-a 'cd /home/user/stack && docker compose run --rm -T --no-deps kipple restore /data/backup/pre-restore-<timestamp>/kipple.db --yes'

A bare `.db` restore also applies a `-wal` file sitting beside it (a pre-restore copy taken after an unclean stop keeps its newest transactions there), and says so. Two restores in the same second get `pre-restore-<ts>` and `pre-restore-<ts>-2`, never the same directory.

**Run restore as Kipple's own user.** `docker compose run` does that by default; do not add `-u root`. A restore run as root would leave a root-owned `0600` `kipple.db` that the server (nonroot) cannot open. If it detects root it warns and hands the new database and the pre-restore directory to the data directory's owner, but do not rely on that.

If the refusal says "kipple is running": the service is still up (`docker compose stop kipple`), or
a second `run` is open. Do not delete `kipple.lock`; it is not a file marker, the OS drops it.

## Phase 2 deploy: extra steps

Phase 1 (`v0.1.0`) has no export button and no restore command, and phase 2 migrates the schema
(0002, 0003) on its first start. So:

1. **Take an off-box copy of the phase 1 data before building phase 2.** Stop the service so the
   WAL is checkpointed and `kipple.db` alone is complete, copy it out, then continue:

       ssh host-a 'cd /home/user/stack && docker compose stop kipple && docker cp kipple:/data/kipple.db /tmp/kipple-phase1.db'
       scp host-a:/tmp/kipple-phase1.db '<backup-dir>\kipple\kipple-phase1-YYYYMMDD.db'
       ssh host-a 'rm /tmp/kipple-phase1.db'

   (`docker cp` works on a stopped container.) The no-downtime alternative is the nightly
   `kipple-snapshot.db` (see above), up to a day old.
2. Pull, build, start (named service): the existing `git pull`, `docker compose build kipple`,
   `docker compose up -d kipple`. The first start writes
   `/data/backup/pre-migration-1-3-<ns>.db` (on the volume) and migrates.
3. First thing in the new UI: **Export backup**, saved off-box. That is the first backup that
   contains phase 2 data.

### Roll back to phase 1

There are no down migrations and the phase 1 binary refuses a newer schema, so a rollback restores
a schema-1 database. Everything read or starred since the snapshot is lost, so decide with that in
mind.

1. Stop the service: `docker compose stop kipple`.
2. Find the snapshot: `docker run --rm -v host-a_kipple_data:/data:ro alpine ls -la /data/backup`.
   Use the newest `pre-migration-1-3-*.db`, or the off-box `kipple-phase1-*.db` from step 1.
3. Restore it **with the phase 2 image, before rebuilding** (phase 1 has no restore command):

       ssh host-a 'cd /home/user/stack && docker compose run --rm -T --no-deps kipple restore /data/backup/pre-migration-1-3-<ns>.db --yes'
       # or the off-box copy:
       ssh host-a 'cd /home/user/stack && docker compose run --rm -T --no-deps kipple restore - --yes' < kipple-phase1-YYYYMMDD.db

4. Check out phase 1 on Host-A (`cd /home/user/kipple && git checkout v0.1.0`), then
   `docker compose build kipple && docker compose up -d kipple`.
5. Sign in again (restore signed every session out).
